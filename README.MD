# Openscad labeled choc keycaps

keycaps.scad takes pre-existing single keycap meshes (here 1u.stl and 1.5u.stl), a layout describing multiple keys (see layout.cad), then instantiate and label each key. it also add a bevel on the rear sides and rotates the key on it for 3d printing.

The keycap model itself is a reimplementation in Onshape of the great KEA caps : https://github.com/klouderone/KEA-choc-keycaps

I generated my layout.cad from the Vial layout  with a quick script.
